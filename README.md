# CS231n_Spring_2018_Assignment

[CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2018/): Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, a course from stanford.

This is my CS231n course assignment repository, which includes 3 assignments and my handwritten notebooks. I worked through the assignments to reinforce my understanding of deep learning computer vision.
